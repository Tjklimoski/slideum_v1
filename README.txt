# SLIDEum

Version 1, written in pure HTML, CSS, and JS. no frameworks were involved in this version.

The goal is to turn the 3 x 3 grid of letters into 6 intersecting words - one word for each row and column.

Use the WASD keys to move the row/column selctor around the gameboard. Use the arrow keys to scroll the row/column left, right, up, and down.

The tiles will turn ðŸŸ¨ if you create a valid word but in the wrong position.

The tiles will turn ðŸŸ© if you create a valid word in the correct position.

Version 2 is in development and will utalize a backend to handle game logic, a mongoDB database to store puzzle state and daily stats, allow for user authentication via Google OAuth, and will use React for the front-end.
